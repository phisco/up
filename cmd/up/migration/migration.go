The 'migration' command is designed to facilitate the seamless migration of control planes from Crossplane or Universal
Crossplane (XP/UXP) environments to Upbound's Managed Control Planes. 

This tool simplifies the process of transferring your existing Crossplane configurations and states into the Upbound
platform, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal downtime.

For detailed information on each command and its options, use the '--help' flag with the specific command (e.g., 'up alpha migration export --help').
